# Project Descriptions
The projects used as notebooks are listed here. The details of the projects are given in the relevant sections.

## Embedding_Models
The mechanism and impact of tokenizers in transformers are studied in this project. We use `sentence-transformers` library from https://sbert.net/
and observe different parts of the transformer model to apply and output contextual embeddings after tokenizing.

## Tokenizers
In this notebook, 3 different tokenizers have been implemented from HuggingFace library - BPE, WordPiece and Unigram. These tokenizers produce different tokens with the same input text. The effects can be studied through this notebook
